Welcome to my Capture The Flag (CTF) journey! Here you'll find my solutions, reflections, and learning progress as I tackle challenges on picoGym (picoCTF) and beyond.
🚩 Solving "Obedient Cat" – My First picoCTF Flag!
Challenge Overview

Platform: picoGym (picoCTF)
Challenge Name: Obedient Cat
Category: General Skills

How I Solved It
Accessed the challenge description on the picoCTF platform.
Downloaded the provided file (it contains the flag in plain sight).
Used the cat command (on Linux/Mac) or a text editor to open and view the file.
Located the flag, as expected, right inside the file.

What I Learned
Basic file handling
Using simple shell commands
Navigating CTF platforms

Reflections
This beginner-friendly challenge was really helpful for getting comfortable with the CTF process, the picoCTF interface, and basic file handling skills. Scoring my first flag on a real platform is a huge confidence boost – highly recommend for all newcomers to cybersecurity!

Tips for Beginners
Start with intro problems to ensure your setup works and get familiar with the platform.
Early, easy wins help build momentum and understanding.
Don’t hesitate to use simple tools—often, that’s all that’s required.

Next Steps
Now that I’ve gotten my feet wet, I’m moving on to more advanced challenges with tools like CyberChef and Python. Excited to keep leveling up!
